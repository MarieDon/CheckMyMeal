### What is CheckMyMeal
CheckMyMeal App is an app that calculates your BMI and depending on your gender, it tells you how many calories you should intake that day. 
It also plans your meal plan structure for the day so you don't go over the ideal calorie limit and it gives you options of food to choose from.
You can look back and search days of the week and see what you ate that day.

### About
Before I started any coding, I planned out the rough idea on paper of how I wanted my app to look and how I wanted it to function. 
My final version isn't identical to my plan but that was just a rough though on paper and it really helped me get the ideas out there. (pictures shown below)

For the colours and images in my app, I used warm, happy colours with a fruit to match the background image. 
I wanted all the screens to be different but have something in common to have a link. My solution to that was using ombre backgrounds.
Even though they're all different colours, theyâ€™re all the same style.

### Persistence
This app has a small database that allows user to save their meal when a button is clicked. It can be viewed in a recycler viewer.
